![Overview](./paper/Fig1.png)

Supporting material for the paper ["Biophysical principles predict fitness of SARS-CoV-2 variants"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.23.549087v3) ([bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.23.549087v3)). Figures and supplementary data for that paper are in the [paper/](paper/) directory.


Plots and tables are generated by running various notebooks:
- [main_logistic.ipynb](main/main_logistic.ipynb):Notebook to generate figure 2, fitting the biophysical model using population fitness and experimental measured $K_D$.
- [main_ML.ipynb](main/main_ML.ipynb):Notebook to generate figure 3, using ML-predicted $K_D$ to estimate RBD fitness. To run the code, please download the ESM embedings from (https://zenodo.org/records/11267983)
- [main_epistasis.ipynb](main/main_epistasis.ipynb):Notebook to generate figure 4, investigating epistasis within the fitness landscape fitted by the biophysical model.
- [main_logistic_time.ipynb](main/main_logistic_time.ipynb):Notebook to generate the rolling window fitness comparison in figure 3.
